 Day 1 ✦
## 🕰️ Morning Blessings (8:30 AM – 9:30 AM)
My first day at GNDEC started in the most peaceful way possible. We gathered at the College Gdwara Sahib for the blessings of Shri Guru Granth Sahib Ji. The atmosphere was calm and full of positive energy, and it felt like the perfect start to my college journey. Students from IT and CSE departments attended the path and kirtan, seeking blessings for our future tech dreams. After the ceremony, we all had langar at Girls Hostel No. 2, which added a warm and welcoming touch to the morning.

## 📖 Orientation & Legacy
After this spiritual start, the faculty gave us our college prospectus and guided us to the auditorium. There, we were introduced to the 70-year history, legacy, and pride of GNDEC. Listening to the story of how the college has grown over the decades made me feel proud to be a part of it. The orientation was not just about rules and academics, but also about understanding the values the college stands for.

## 🎥 Alumni Inspiration
We also watched a motivational video featuring two of our alumni — Mr. Sangum Arora and Mr. Arshpreet Singh, who is currently placed at Airtel. Their journeys showed us that with hard work and dedication, big dreams are achievable. It was motivating to see people from our own college doing so well in their careers.
